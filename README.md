**Turtle Crossing Game**

This is a fun, simple turtle crossing game where the player controls a turtle that must avoid moving cars and reach the top of the screen. The player advances through levels by successfully reaching the top, and the game speed increases with each level. If the player collides with a car, the game ends.

**Features**

Player-controlled turtle that moves upward with the arrow key.

Moving cars that spawn randomly and travel across the screen.

Increasing difficulty with each level as car speed increases.

A scoreboard that displays the current level.

Game over screen when the player collides with a car.

**Installation**

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The game uses the turtle graphics library, which comes pre-installed with Python.

**Controls**

Up Arrow: Move the turtle upwards.

The goal is to avoid colliding with the moving cars and reach the top of the screen.

**Game Logic**

The player starts at the bottom of the screen and moves upwards by pressing the Up arrow.

Cars move from right to left across the screen at increasing speeds with each level.

When the player collides with a car, the game ends, and a "GAME OVER" message is displayed.

If the player reaches the top of the screen, they move to the next level, and the car speed increases.
